# The Shackle Almanac

This booklet contains the (early) design and documentation of the Shackle constraint modelling framework.
The Shackle project was started as a redesign of the MiniZinc compiler, and the handling the MiniZinc language remains its primary goal.
Early research into a design of such a framework was conducted in Jip J. Dekker's thesis: ["A Modern Architecture for Constraint Modelling Languages"](https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/A_Modern_Architecture_for_Constraint_Modelling_Languages/16968229)
The intention of this document is to be updated throughout the design process as to both keep a history of the design of this framework and make this a start of the internal documentation of the framework.
