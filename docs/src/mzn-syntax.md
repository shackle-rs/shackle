# MiniZinc Syntax Changes

New syntax includes:
- Tuples
- Records (which are transformed into tuples)
- `case` expression with complex pattern matching (possibly compiled into `case` with simple matching)
- Namespacing/module system

Syntax still to be discussed:
- TypeInst variables syntax
- Function type syntax
- Module syntax
